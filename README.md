This is just a hobby project as a surrogate for Habitica.

Tt is supposed to be used just by the author (as for now anyways), hard to tell if anyone else could find some use.

The project is created to make me stick to the useful habits and to avoid procrastination as much as possible. Even though it seems quite basic, it really helps me in my day to day life. I found it more useful for my porposes than Habitica.

but first the data must be downloaded: ```python3 get-data-dp.py```
