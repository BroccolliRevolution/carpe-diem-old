This is just a hobby project used as a surrogate for Habitica.

It is supposed to be used just by me (as for now anyways), hard to tell if anyone else could find some use.

The project is created to make me stick to the useful habits and to avoid procrastination as much as possible. Even though it seems quite basic, it really helps me in my day-to-day life. I found it more useful for my porposes than Habitica.


run ```jupyter notebook``` to visualize some data 
but first the data must be downloaded: ```python3 get-data-dp.py```
